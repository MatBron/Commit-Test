							<strong>Viking Tactics Background (first pages):</strong><br>
							When Ret. Sgt. Major Kyle Lamb steps onto a range or into a design room, he does so looking
							through the eyes of somebody who has been there and done it. As a former U.S. Army Special
							Forces Operator, Lamb takes lessons learned from 21 years in the military and just as much
							time spent as a competitive shooter and designs products with the soldier and competitive
							shooter in mind.<br>
							<br>
							It all started with the Viking Tactics Sling, a two-point sling designed for maximum
							comfort, durability, adjustability, and flexibility. It didn't take long to see that Viking
							Tactics had a winning product as soldiers in the US Special Forces Community immediately
							took to the sling for its innovative design, using the sling in combat operations in Iraq
							and Afghanistan. What began with a 2-point sling has now developed into a whole line of
							products designed for the soldier and competitive shooter. Current products such as the
							Viking Tactics Light Mount, L.U.S.A., and VTAC Handguard are known for their simplicity and
							utility. Our line of VTAC/5.11 bags provide space, sturdiness, and versatility and our line
							of Viking Tactics Apparel pay homage to the Vikings with the old Viking saying, "Trample the
							Weak, Hurdle the Dead."<br>
							<br>
							We continue to develop products to see to the needs of the soldier as well as the needs of
							the competitive shooter. We hope to provide you with products designed to increase accuracy
							and maximize lethality on the battlefield.
